# Big Data Project: Google Local Reviews üá∫üá∏ üó∫Ô∏è üìà

This repository hosts the code for the Big Data Project exam @ UniBo on [Google Local Reviews](https://mcauleylab.ucsd.edu/public_datasets/gdrive/googlelocal/#sample-review).

This Dataset contains review information on Google map (ratings, text, images, etc.), business metadata (address, geographical info, descriptions, category information, price, open hours, and MISC info), and links (relative businesses) up to Sep 2021 in the United States.

Our analysis is limited to the following states: Alabama, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Washington.
We focus on the reviews and metadata of businesses in these states.

## Dataset

### Reviews

- `user_id`: ID of the reviewer;
- `name`: name of the reviwer;
- `time`: time of the review (unix time);
- `rating`: rating of the business;
- `text`: text of the review;
- `pics`: pictures of the review;
- `resp`: business response to the review including unix time and text of the response;
  - `time`: time of the response (unix time);
  - `text`: text of the response;
- **[‚û∞ FK] `gmap_id`: ID of the business**;

### Metadata

- `name`: name of the business;
- `address`: address of the business;
- **[‚û∞ PK] `gmap_id`: ID of the business**;
- `description`: description of the business;
- `latitude`: latitude of the business;
- `longitude`: longitude of the business;
- `category`: categories of the business;
- `avg_rating`: average rating of the business;
- `num_of_reviews`: number of reviews;
- `price`: price of the business;
- `hours`: open hours;
- `MISC`: MISC information;
- `state`: the current status of the business (e.g., `permanently closed`);
- `relative_results`: relative businesses recommended by Google;
- `url`: URL of the business;

## Jobs

### Job 1

The goal of this job is to understand, year by year, whether greater frequency in responding to reviews has an impact on the average rating received.

Specifically:

- For each year and business, the average reviews, rate, and average response time are calculated;
- Based on the rate and average response time, an additional attribute "response strategy" is calculated that categorizes the business in a particular year into four categories ("Rapid and frequent," "Slow but frequent," "Occasional," or "Rare or none");
- Aggregation based on the "response strategy," year, and state to get the average rate and number of businesses within the category.

### Job 2

Job 2 computes, annually, for each business state, category and price range the average rating, assigning a rating.

In detail:

- for each business, the average rating of the reviews is calculated by grouping them by year;
- aggregating by business category, state and price range the average rating of the reviews is calculated;
- based on the average rating an additional attribute "business suggestion" is processed, which provides a rating on the business categories, as follows:
  - average rating < 2: "Not recommended"
  - average rating 2-3.5: "Discreet"
  - average rating 3.5-4.5: "Recommended"
  - average rating > 4.5: "Highly recommended"

### How to get the dataset?

UniBo member? You can download full dataset from [here](https://liveunibo-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/luca_tassinari10_studio_unibo_it/ErdSkAIdiHlAqnXVcEfHHMYBJxc80u6gVmfz6fmBMwCN_A?e=0cXkhT).

Otherwise:

- Download from [here](https://mcauleylab.ucsd.edu/public_datasets/gdrive/googlelocal/#complete-data) all the `ndjson` files;
  - only Alabama, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Washington are used in this project;
- Merge together reviews files with `cat`, like `cat reviews-*.ndjson > reviews.ndjson`;
- Get rid of reviews < 2015 (`1420070400000` unix epoch time corresponds to `2015-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`):

  ```bash
  pv -l reviews.ndjson | jq -c 'select(.time != null and .time > 1420070400000)' > reviews.ndjson
  ```

### Dataset Sample

Dataset sample is obtained using the following command:

```bash
pv -l reviews.ndjson | awk 'BEGIN{srand(42)} rand()<=0.05 {print}' > sample.ndjson
```

### Jupyter Notebooks

- Python 3.11 version
- install from `requirements.txt`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- make sure to install: `python -m spylon_kernel install --user`
- to open a jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`

### Cluster operations

#### AWS profile

To create a new AWS profile create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

```env
ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access_key_id>
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret_access_key>
SESSION_TOKEN=<session_token>
```

and run

```bash
./gradlew createProfile
```

Or, **alternatively**:

```bash
./gradlew createProfile -PaccessKeyId=<access_key_id> -PsecretAccessKey=<secret_access_key> -PsessionToken=<session_token>
```

This command will create a new profile named with the same project name.

#### Dataset load

S3 bucket name: `google-local-reviews-analysis`.

```bash
# from the project root
aws s3api list-buckets --profile <profile-name> # list buckets
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket google-local-reviews-analysis --profile <profile-name> # create new bucket
# copy metadata ndjson file
aws s3 cp ./dataset/metadata.ndjson s3://google-local-reviews-analysis/dataset/metadata.ndjson --profile <profile-name>
# load reviews ndjson file
aws s3 cp ./dataset/reviews.ndjson s3://google-local-reviews-analysis/dataset/reviews.ndjson --profile <profile-name>
```

#### AWS EMR cluster creation

Add to the previously created `.env` file the following content:

```env
KEY_PAIR_PATH=<path_to_your_key_pair>
```

and run

```bash
./gradlew createCluster
```

This task depends upon the `createProfile` task, so no need to run it separately.

### Deploy jobs on AWS EMR cluster

Add a new Intellij Run Configuration with `Run` -> `Edit Configurations` -> `+` -> `Spark Submit Cluster`:

- Name: Spark Cluster
- Region: us-east-1
- Remote Target: Add EMR connection
- Authentication type: Profile from credentials file
- Profile name: (the one you set in 101-1.d)
- Click on "Test connection" to verify: if you cannot connect or there are no deployed cluster, the connection will not be saved
- Enter a new SSH Configuration
- Host: the address of the primary node of the cluster, i.e., the MasterPublicDnsName
- Username: hadoop
- Authentication type: Key pair
- Private key file: point to your `.ppk`/`.pem` file
- Test the connection
- Application: point to the .jar file inside the `build/libs` folder (it can be generated with `./gradlew build`).
- Class: `jobs.Job1` or `jobs.Job2` depending on the job you want to run
- Run arguments: `basic`, `optimized` or any other argument you want to pass to the job
- Before launch: Upload Files Through SFTP
- Result submit command:

```bash
/bin/spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster --class <fully-qualified-class> --name "Spark Cluster" $HOME/<jar> <args>
```
